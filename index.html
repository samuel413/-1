            <pre>A man shows you into his room.
There is nothing inside, save for a box and a photograph.
The photograph shows another man.
You ask him who is in the photograph, and he responds:

<strong>BROTHERS AND SISTERS I HAVE NONE,
BUT THAT MAN'S FATHER IS MY FATHER'S SON.
</strong>
You ask him what is in the box, and he responds:

<strong>YOU PLUS ONE EFF THREE ONE NINE.</strong>

You ask him why there's nothing else in the room.

<strong>I LEFT EVERYTHING ELSE OUTSIDE,
BY THE THING THAT YOU NEED TO CLICK.
THE SEVEN LETTER WORD THAT CONTAINS MANY MORE LETTERS.</strong>

What happens when the contents of the box passes
directly in front of the person in the photograph?</pre>
